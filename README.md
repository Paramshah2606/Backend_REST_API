# Backend_REST_API
I have created basic website which has functionality like quora or other blog websites. I have performed all CRUD operations with REST API.This operation includes seeing all post on home page,adding a new post,selecting and viewing particular post,editing particular post and lastly delete particular post.
For this CRUD operations I have used differnet methods like GET,POST,PATCH and DELETE.Apart from that I have also used different npm packages like ejs,uuid and method-override.

Technologies: NodeJS,ExpressJS and other npm packages
